## Available Versions

You can see all images available to pull from Docker Hub via the [Tags](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/fonoster/rox/tags?page=1) page. Docker tag names that begin with a "change type" word such as task, bug, or feature are available for testing and may be removed at any time.

> The version is the same of the Asterisk this is image is based on

## Installation

## Specs for Dialogflow backend

To allow for seamless integration between Dialogflow and Rox, we introduced the concept of Effects. Effects are actions sent from Dialogflow to Rox so you don't have to program the behavior every time. All you need to do is send the Effect's payload and Rox will react accordingly.

You can set multiple responses in Dialogflow. The Effects will run in sequence.

> We also provide compatibility to Dialogflow Phone Gateway. To activate the compatibility you need to pass the environment variable `INTENTS_ENGINE_PLATFORM=TELEPHONY`.

<table>
<tr>
<td> Effect ID </td> <td> Description </td> <td> Payload Example </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 

`say` 

</td>
<td> The Effect will randomly pick a textual response and play it back to the user </td>
<td>
  
```json
{
  "effect": "say",
  "parameters": {
    "responses": [
      "Goodbye!",
      "Talk later",
      "Bye!",
      "Have a good one!"
    ]
  }
}
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 

`hangup` 

</td>
<td> The hangup Effect will close the call </td>
<td>

```json
{
  "effect": "hangup"
}
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 

`send_data` 

</td>
<td> Use this Effect send arbitrary data to the client. Note that this only works with clients that subscribe for events</td>
<td>

```json
{
  "effect": "send_data",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "map",
    "icon": "https://freeicons.net/icons/map.png",
    "link": "https://goo.gl/maps/YTum2VeZSQwNB4ik6"
  }
}
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 

`transfer` 

</td>
<td> Forward call to a different endpoint </td>
<td>

```json
{
  "effect": "transfer",
  "parameters": {
    "destination": "17853178070",
    "record": true
  }
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

> Notes: The parameter `type` is set to map in the example, but you can send anything that makes send to the client. If the parameter `allRequiredParamsPresent` is set to true, the fulfillmentText will take precedence over the custom effects.

## Dynamic Project Configuration

In certain scenarios, you will want to configure your bot dynamically. You can achieve this by creating an initialization endpoint that responds to HTTP requests. 

To dynamically configure your project, you first need to set the `INIT_ENDPOINT` to the URL with your configuration. 

Rox will send these query parameters:

```none
  accessKeyId: string
  number: string
  callerNumber: string
  sessionId: string
```

The endpoint must be prepared to receive `GET` requests, and respond with JSON with the following parameters: 

```none
  intentsEngineProjectId: string    // This is the only mandatory parameter
  ttsVoice: string
  languageCode: string
  intentsEngineAgent: string
  intentsEngineLocation: string
  intentsEnginePlatform?: string
  initialDtmf: string
  welcomeIntentTrigger: string
  enableEvents: boolean
  activationTimeout: number
  activationIntent: string
  interactionTimeout: number
```

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are used in the entry point script to render configuration templates. You can specify the values of these variables during `docker run`, `docker-compose up`, or in Kubernetes manifests in the `env` array.

- `INTENTS_ENGINE` - Use to select the intents engine. Accepts `[dialogflow.es, dialogflow.cx]`. **Required**
- `INTENTS_ENGINE_PROJECT_ID` - If set, it will overwrite the `project_id` on Dialogflow Engine
- `INTENTS_ENGINE_AGENT` - Intents Agent identifier.  **Required for `dialogflow.cx`**
- `INTENTS_ENGINE_LOCATION` - Region where the bot was deployed.  **Required for `dialogflow.cx`**
- `INTENTS_ENGINE_PLATFORM` - If set to `TELEPHONY` it will emulate Dialogflow's Phone Gateway behavior
- `ASR_ENGINE` - Use to select the ASR engine. Accepts `[google]`. **Required**
- `TTS_ENGINE` - Use to select the TTS engine. Accepts `[google]`. **Required**
- `TTS_VOICE` - Name of the voice. Check https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voices for a list of Google TTS voices. **Required**
- `INITIAL_DTMF` - Set if you want to send a DTMF at the beginning of the call
- `WELCOME_INTENT_TRIGGER` - Set if you want to ask the backend for a welcome intent
- `ACTIVATION_INTENT` - Set to the desired intent if you want to have an activation command. If this is set, the `INTERACTION_TIMEOUT` will have no effects
- `INTERACTION_TIMEOUT` - Timeout, in seconds, to ask again for user input. Use `-1` for no timeout. Defaults to `-1`
- `ENABLE_EVENTS` - If set to `true` it will send events to WS clients subscribed to events. Defaults to `false`
- `ACTIVATION_TIMEOUT` - Time in seconds for the duration of the `AWAKE_ACTIVE` state, set for the activation command. After this time the bot will return to `AWAKE_PASSIVE` and new intents will be ignored. Defaults to `15000`
- `LANGUAGE_CODE` - Sets the default language for the application. Defaults to `en-US`
- `GOOGLE_CONFIG_FILE` - The file containing the Service Account with access to Google Speech APIs and Dialogflow
- `OTL_EXPORTER_PROMETHEUS_PORT` - Sets Prometheus port. Defaults to `9090`
- `OTL_EXPORTER_PROMETHEUS_ENDPOINT` - Sets Prometheus endpoint. Defaults to `/metrics`
- `OTL_EXPORTER_JAEGER_URL` - If set, it will send traces to Jaeger
- `OTL_EXPORTER_GCP_ENABLED` - If set, it will send traces to GCP
- `OTL_EXPORTER_ZIPKIN_URL` - If set, it will send traces to Zipkin
- `INIT_ENDPOINT` - Optional endpoint to obtain the project's configuration dynamically
- `INIT_ENDPOINT_USERNAME` - Optional username for the init endpoint
- `INIT_ENDPOINT_PASSWORD` - Optional password for the init endpoint

## Exposed Ports

- `3000` - Port to start a session request
- `3001` - Port to subscribe for `send_data` effects
- `9090` - Default Prometheus port

## Volumes

- `/etc/rox/google.json` - This must exist if `INTENTS_ENGINE=dialogflow`, or `ASR_ENGINE=google`, or `TTS_ENGINE=google`

## TODO

- Add authentication to secure the events port
- Include a `--log-level` flag
- Include a `--app-port` so we can change the default voice application port
- Include a `--events-port` so we can change the default events port
